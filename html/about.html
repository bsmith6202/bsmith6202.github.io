        <h1>About

            I am a student at the University of Pennsylvania studying Philosophy and Computer Science. I am passionate about political philosophy and especially interested in the intersection of ethics and technology.
            
            <br>I am a head teaching assistant for CIS 1100, the introductory CIS course in Java at Penn. This is the course that first got me excited about computer science so I love being able to share my excitement with first-time coders. 
            
            <br>I also am a research assistant for the CSS Lab at Penn, where I am a part of a research team studying political deliberation and how it impacts affective polarization.
            
            <br>Outside of class I enjoy running, skiing, exploring Philly with friends, watching stand-up comedy, and playing board games.
